                    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
                    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
                     when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
                     specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into 
                     electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in 
                     the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, 
                     and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including 
                     versions of Lorem Ipsum.   
        </p>

            <p class="text">      
                    There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority 
                    have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which 
                    don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum,
                     you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
